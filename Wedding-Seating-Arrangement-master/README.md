# Wedding-Seating-Arrangement
Generating CNF sentences for an input instance of wedding seating arrangements

1. Write a program to generate CNF sentences for an input instance of wedding seating arrangements;
2. Implement a SAT solver to find a satisfying assignment for any given CNF sentences. In this project, I implemented a modified version of the DPLL algorithm(Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland);
3. Trace all the steps to search for a solution for an instance of wedding.
