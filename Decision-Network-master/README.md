# Decision-Network
A decision network uses a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) to represent a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies within a probabilistic model, while a decision network extends the Bayesian Network to include decision nodes and utility nodes

A decision network (Chapter 16, AIMA) uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies within a probabilistic model, while a decision network extends the Bayesian network to include decision nodes and utility nodes. Functionality:

Calculate a specific joint, marginal or conditional probability;
Calculate the expected utility of a particular decision, or determine the decision with the maximum expected utility.
